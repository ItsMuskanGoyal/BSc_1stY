Suggested Practical List
1. Create and transform vectors and matrices (the transpose vector (matrix) conjugate transpose
of a vector (matrix))
2. Generate the matrix into echelon form and find its rank.
3. Find cofactors, determinant, adjoint and inverse of a matrix.
4. Solve a system of Homogeneous and non-homogeneous equations using Gauss elimination
method.
1. Solve a system of Homogeneous equations using the Gauss Jordan method.
6. Generate basis of column space, null space, row space and left null space of a matrix space.
7.Check the linear dependence of vectors. Generate a linear combination of given vectors of Rn/
matrices of the same size and find the transition matrix of given matrix space.
